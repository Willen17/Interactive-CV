             <div class="text-aboutme">
                 <p>Twenty-two years ago, in the chilly and dark forests of VÃ¤rmland, <br> a boy was born called William. </p>
                 <p>Surrounded by a family with roots in media, it was no surprise that <br> William himself decided to pursue a carrer within media.</p>
                 <p>About ten years later, at the age of eleven, William got his first computer. </br>That computer would later become the start to his lifelong love with <br> digital creation.</p>
                 <p>If we fast forward to present time, William has moved to Gothenburg <br> in order to study to become a front-end developer.</p>
