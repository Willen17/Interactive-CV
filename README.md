## Background
---
This is an interactive CV/Resume coded and created by myself using javaScript, CSS and HTML. 

## Idea
---
My initial idea was to create some kind of game-like resume. I got inspired by the animation god [rleonardi](http://www.rleonardi.com/interactive-resume/) and wanted to make something similiar. However, I wanted my version to be way shorter, since most people browsing my resume is doing it to get a quick summary of who I am. 

## Contribution
---
The code is solely written and created by me.

Thanks to the skilled illustrator [Bevouliin](https://bevouliin.com/) for letting me use and alter his sprites and backgrounds.
